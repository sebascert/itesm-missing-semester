# Resources

This section contains a compilation of learning resources for a large number of
domains of CS, we aim to categorize resources into introductory, intermediate
and advanced contents for each topic, among the resources we list there are
videos, courses, articles, books, documentation, etc.

## Categories

- [DSA](dsa/README.md). Data Structures and Algorithms.
- [Tools](tools/README.md). Programmer tools.

## Contributing

If you found some resource to be outdated, please upload an issue for it's
evaluation.

If you wish to contribute with resources please read the following guidelines to
do so, then create a pull request with your changes:

- Resources refer to external material on a subject, preferably accessible via
  internet. Do not include your personal explanations of a subject or related
  content.

- Upload references to resources, such as links or brief instructions on how to
  get access to the resource, but do not upload the resources themselves. This
  is to prevent issues with copyright, resources becoming updated and bloating
  the repository with multimedia contents.

- Avoid listing trivial resources, such as wikipedia pages or official
  documentation (on special cases like the offial docs being obscure, or
  difficult to obtain, ignore this advice), as their listing can be redundant in
  most cases.

- Resources must be grouped based on the start-range of their difficulty (e.g.,
  introductory in introductory-advanced). The finish-range (e.g., advanced in
  introductory-advanced) is not used for grouping.

- Format difficultity ranges for resources as follows:

  - Use this difficultity levels:
    - **introductory**: Introductory material, meant for beginners.
    - **intermediate**: Depends on an previous a grasp of the subject.
    - **advanced**: Most advanced material within the subject.
  - Difficultity range: `least-greatest`
  - Do not format as `same_level-same_level` leave just `level`. Example: avoid
    `introductory-introductory`, instead write just `introductory`.

- Format resource listing as follows:

```md
### Name [type of resource | difficultity range]

Reference to resource (link or instructions to access it).

Brief description of the subject
